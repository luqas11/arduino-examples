# IRJoystick

Example of a **PC** joystick made with an **IR** remote control. The **IRremote** library decodes the **IR** signal from the control, and the **Joystick** library allows the Arduino to be recognized as a **PC** joystick and manages the buttons state.  

The **Joystick** library requires an **ATmega32u4** based board in order to work (e.g. **Leonardo**, **Micro**, etc.).  Requires an **IR** sensor connected to the specified input pin.
