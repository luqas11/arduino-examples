# CPURGBLed
Sets the color of an RGB LED based on the CPU current load percentage. If the load is low, the color will be blue, and if the load is high, it will be red, transitioning smoothly between intermediate values. The CPU load value is sent from a C# simple app, which runs from terminal and asks to the user the Arduino's COM port at startup. The load value is sent as a single printable ASCII character, representing a number between 0 and 100. The Arduino sketch will intepret that character and convert it to a number between 0 and 255, to write that value to analog outputs. Requires an RGB LED connected to PWM-capable pins.
