# SegaJoystick
Adapts a Sega controller to a PC compatible Joystick. Using the SegaController library, the sketch reads the current controller state, and using the Joystick library, presses and releases the corresponding PC Joystick buttons. This enables the Sega cotroller to be used to play PC games. Requires a physical Sega controller wired as the sketch indicates to the Arduino. The Joystick library requires an ATmega32u4 based board in order to work (e.g. Leonardo, Micro, etc.).
