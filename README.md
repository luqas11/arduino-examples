# arduino-examples

Example sketches for Arduino based boards. Mainly based on library examples or internet tutorials, modified to fit my own use cases.

### Development notes:
The sketches can be opened and uploaded using **VSCode** along with the **Arduino official extension**.  

To install libraries, use the `Library Manager` command. If the library is not present in the manager and can be downloaded as a **ZIP** from it's own page, unzip it under the `libraries` folder generated by Arduino on the system (usually placed in `C:\Users\User\Documents`).  

To make the **IDE** recognize the library, use the `Verify` command.  

When moving between sketches, use `Select Sketch` to select the current one, and use `Verify` to rebuild the autogenerated configuration and clear possible path errors.
